Hi, I'm Ahmed AbdelWahab Shawky. I'm a Flutter developer with 1+ year of experience, and I'm looking to take the next step in my career by joining a company. I have developed multiple projects in Flutter, and I'm always looking to improve my skills and learn from expert teams.

My focus is on developing good-looking, responsive, high-quality, and high-performance apps using Flutter. I'm currently dedicating myself to learning everything there is to know about Flutter to become a professional developer in the field.

Skills:

- Flutter development: Proficient in Flutter and its packages, with a good ability to build responsive, high-performance apps.
- State management: Proficient in using provider and riverpod to manage app state, with a focus on implementing clean code patterns.
- Firebase integration: Experience working with Firestore, Storage, Auth, Hosting and Cloud Functions using both NodeJS and Python.
- UI/UX design: Ability to implement UI designs in Flutter with animations and custom shapes.
- Algorithms and data structures: Knowledge of basic algorithms and data structure.
- Self-learning: Strong ability to learn new technologies and tools independently.
